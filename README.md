# Theodo Evolution

This repository contains fake projects used to test Theodo Evolution bundles. Any fake project has its own directory
for which the name must be ``<framework><version>``.

## Vagrant support

As you may have noticed, there is a ``Vagrantfile`` included in this repository. To add a new project you can start 
a virtual machine running ``vagrant up`` (you must have [vagrant](http://www.vagrantup.com/) installed). It will 
create an Ubuntu Precise64 (12.04) VM and install PHP5 cli version.
